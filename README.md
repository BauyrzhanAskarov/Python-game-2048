Approach to Programming: 

We will design each logic function so that when we perform a left swipe, we can use it to perform a right swipe by reversing the matrix and performing a left swipe.
Moving up can be accomplished by using transpose and then moving left.

Moving down can be accomplished by transposing the moving right.
